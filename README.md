### [`sysopIndex`](./sysopIndex/)

Creates an *h*-index-like metric for sysops, and includes some pretty graphs via R; see [User:Amorymeltzer/s-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Amorymeltzer/s-index) for results.  Full instructions are available in the [README](./sysopIndex/README.md), but mainly uses a single shim, [sIndex.sh](./sysopIndex/sIndex.sh).
