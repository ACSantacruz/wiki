### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?


#### S-index
1. Quick way to update graphs on commons?
2. Change fonts?
3. Justify title and legend left?  Gets complicated...
4. Figure out a way to identify users who aren't sysops who only get logs from moves/overwriting
5. Option to specify start date?  Don't pass to getDates, but to calcH/sysopH
6. More exotic export options
    1. Fix academic year X-axis?
    2. Quarters (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12)
        1. Need to tackle X-axis for quarters+fixed...

##### Possible additions
* S-index for just delete/protect/block totals?
    * Or S-index for each individual action family? (d/b/p-index)
    * Leaves out import and rights only
        * Minor issue, likely, but could be interesting
* Include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?
* o-index (geometric mean of h-index and most-cited paper)
