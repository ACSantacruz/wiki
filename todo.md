### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?


#### S-index
1. Quick way to update graphs on commons?
2. Change fonts?
3. Justify title and legend left?  Gets complicated...
4. Figure out a way to identify users who aren't sysops who only get logs from moves/overwriting
5. Turn fixed into option like roll, so that year is fixed12, etc.
    1. Option to specify start date?  Don't pass to getDates, but to calcH/sysopH

* Change how/where determine x-axis (fold into if/elsif for main call)
    * Year if N >12?
* Capture fixed12
* Negate need for offcall?
* Switch matching to eq
* Capture fixed12 and roll1 in sindex


6. Fix academic year X-axis

##### Possible additions
* S-index for just delete/protect/block totals?
    * Or S-index for each individual action family? (d/b/p-index)
    * Leaves out import and rights only
        * Minor issue, likely, but could be interesting
* Include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?
* o-index (geometric mean of h-index and most-cited paper)
