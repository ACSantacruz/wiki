uw-copyright-new: {{{icon|[[File:Control copyright icon.svg|30px|link=|alt=Control copyright icon]]}}} Hello {{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>BASEPAGENAME}}, and welcome to Wikipedia. {{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>#if:{{{article|{{{1|}}}}}}|Your additions to [[:{{{article|{{{1}}}}}}]] have been removed in whole or in part, as they appear to have added copyrighted content without evidence that the source material is in the [[public domain]] or has been released by its owner or legal agent under a [[WP:COMPLIC|suitably-free and compatible]] copyright license. (''To request such a release, see [[Wikipedia:Requesting copyright permission]]''.)}} While we appreciate your contributions to Wikipedia, there are certain things you must keep in mind about using information from sources to avoid [[copyright]] and [[plagiarism]] issues.

*You can only copy/translate a ''small'' amount of a source, and you must mark what you take as a direct quotation with double [[quotation mark]]s (") and cite the source using an [[WP:IC|inline citation]]. You can read about this at [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]] in the sections on "text". See also [[Help:Referencing for beginners]], for how to cite sources here.
*Aside from limited quotation, you must put all information ''in your own words and structure'', in proper [[paraphrase]]. Following the source's words too closely can create [[derivative work|copyright problems]], so it is not permitted here; see [[Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing]]. (There is a college-level introduction to paraphrase, with examples, [https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/using_research/paraphrase_exercises/index.html hosted by the Online Writing Lab of Purdue].) Even when using your own words, you are still, however, asked to cite your sources to [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verify]] the information and to demonstrate that the content is not [[Wikipedia:No original research|original research]]. 
*Our primary policy on using copyrighted content is [[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]. You may also want to review [[Wikipedia:Copy-paste]]. 
*If ''you'' own the copyright to the source you want to copy or are a legally designated agent, you ''may'' be able to license that text so that we can publish it here. Understand, though, that unlike many other sites, where a person can license their content for use there and retain non-free ownership, that is not possible at Wikipedia. Rather, the release of content must be irrevocable, ''to the world'', into the [[public domain]] (PD) or under a [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Copyright#Can I add something to Wikipedia that I got from somewhere else?|suitably-free and compatible]] copyright license. Such a release must be done in a verifiable manner, so that the authority of the person purporting to release the copyright is evidenced. See [[Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials]].
*In ''very rare cases'' (that is, for sources that are PD or compatibly licensed) it ''may'' be possible to include greater portions of a source text. ''However'', please seek help at [[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]], the [[Wikipedia:Help desk|help desk]] or the [[Wikipedia:Teahouse|Teahouse]] before adding such content to the article. 99.9% of sources ''may not'' be added in this way, so it is necessary to seek confirmation first. If you ''do'' confirm that a source is public domain or compatibly licensed, you will still need to provide full attribution; see [[Wikipedia:Plagiarism]] for the steps you need to follow.
*Also note that Wikipedia articles may not be copied or translated without attribution. If you want to copy or translate from another Wikipedia project or article, you must follow the copyright attribution steps in [[Wikipedia:Translation#How to translate]]. See also [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia]].

It's very important that contributors understand and follow these practices, as policy requires that people who persistently do not must be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing. If you have any questions about this, you are welcome to leave me a message on my talk {{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>#if:{{{student|{{{3|}}}}}}|page or to reach out to your campus ambassador|page}}. {{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>#if:{{{comment|{{{2|}}}}}}|{{{comment|{{{2}}}}}}}} Thank you. <!--Template:uw-copyright-new--><noinclude>
