### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?


#### S-index
##### Todo
1. Consider color/aes options
    * Basically, the smoothing graph looks too similar on longer periods
    * Change aesthetics so smoothings are dashed but colored while lines are solid and colored?
2. More exotic export options
    1. Academic year
    2. Quarters
	    1. Calendar
	    2. Financial
3. Organize
    1. S-index, s-index, S index, s index, or what?
    2.  Put in directories
4. Write page
    1. Test png->svg
    2. Easy way to upload graphs to commons?
5. Advertize?  WT:ADMIN, RFA, BN, INACTIVEADMIN?
    1. Note future options

##### Possible additions
* Option to specify start date?
    * Don't pass to getDates, but to calcH/sysopH
* Justify title and legend left?  Gets complicated...
* S-index for just delete/protect/block totals?
    * Or S-index for each individual action family? (d/b/p-index)
    * Leaves out import and rights only
        * Minor issue, likely, but could be interesting
* Also include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?
* o-index (geometric mean of h-index and most-cited paper)

##### XTool questions
- Date in range (defaults to 00:00 UTC start date, 23:59 UTC end date)
- How determine who was former sysop?  I think it's accurate but curious
- Any chance any users who were never sysops in there?
    - Just based off presence of log entries
- Revdel in delete?  Log revdel in delete?
- Specify range in api?
