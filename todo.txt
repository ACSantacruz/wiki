### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?

#### S-index
- calch = bulk calc over period, goes through h_index files for each month, calls sysop
- sysop = actual calculations
- workflow:
-- bash shim
-- getData -> getDates
-- shim curl
-- shim calc md5
-- checkData confirm timestamp
-- table
-- calcH (calls sysop)
1. (Re)Write
- Format changed between 18 feb 2010 and 21 feb 2010
- Start March 2010, or process separately
- Wait 2012 or 2010?????
- Something big hapened in 2014 between March and April
- sysopdev to take only user and total
- table to take name and save... somewhere
- also calculate md5, export to list
- bash shim checks lists
- checkData finds timestamp, ensures reasonable given title
- Move sysopHindex into calcH, rename.  Add option for files?
2. Map out pipline (what categories, what measures, etc.)
- finance isn't rolling, quarter is
- could set up rolling average, allow x number of months
- then make quarters quarters like finance
- make years years
- add academic calendar a la non rolling
- remove problematic users?
- allow for deletion, protection, etc indicdes
3. Figure out how I want to graph various data (quarters, months, years, etc.) (also include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?)
4. Bash shim to lump it all together and update?  Make sure don't re-download everything
- Need to deal with renames, etc
5. Easy way to get graphs on wiki (ugh commons)
- Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Graph:Chart
6. Advertize?  WT:ADMIN, RFA, BN, INACTIVEADMIN
