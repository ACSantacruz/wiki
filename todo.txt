### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?


#### S-index
- ACTUAL NEW PLAN
-- Update shim
--- Take input option (all, later exotic options, etc.)
-- R for nice graphs
--- R2 fit
--- Smoothing?  geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
---- Think about curve options and compare to rolling
-- More exotic export options
--- 3/6/9/12 rolling
--- Last N number of period (12*N months, etc.)
--- Match inputs to calcH with inputs to Rscript
-- CHECK DATA
--- Delete old files
- S-index, s-index, S index, s index, or what?
-- Clean up code
--- CalcH - maybe merge subroutines?
--- SysopH - subroutine repeated calls


0. Rewrite using xtools
- Double check that xtools includes everything (revdel (in del), etc.)
- Double check results are the same
- Massive rewrite for calcH.pl (well actually sysopHindex.pl)
-- Be careful, since total for jan via AS is 2018-02-01 minus 2018-01-01
-- Check if https://github.com/x-tools/xtools/commit/429907894301075a4686c5c46e2da79d75aeaf81 affected api versus curl
1. (Re)Write
- Format changed between 18 feb 2010 and 21 feb 2010
- Start March 2010, or process separately
- Wait 2012 or 2010?????
- Something big hapened in 2014 between March and April
- OKAY FOUND IT: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:JamesR/AdminStats&diff=599109968&oldid=599107237&diffonly=1
- Started listing everyone who made a logged action, not just current sysops
- Presents an issue - data previous to this likely unreliable (See Zoe for an example)
- But starting data April 2014 gives us a really short timespan
- USE ADMINSTATS XTOOL
- [[Special:Permalink/832905359#AdminStats fix]]
- Use API: https://xtools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/project.html#admin-statistics
- Will have to parse json, but okay...
- Actually, can't use json, API is only limited to <=30 days before present
- Just pull actual html and parse.  Annoying but that's what perl is for.
- Date in xtool probably 00:00 UTC so for all of Jan need to go 0101 to 0201 not 0131
-- Actually maybe not!
- sysopdev to take only user and total
- table to take name and save... somewhere
- also calculate md5, export to list
- bash shim checks lists
- checkData finds timestamp, ensures reasonable given title
- Move sysopHindex into calcH, rename.  Add option for files?
- Shouldn't open files in subroutine, do so beforehand and... pass?
2. Map out pipeline (what categories, what measures, etc.)
- finance isn't rolling, quarter is
- could set up rolling average, allow x number of months
- then make quarters quarters like finance
- make years years
- add academic calendar a la non rolling
- remove problematic users?
- allow for deletion, protection, etc indicdes
3. Figure out how I want to graph various data (quarters, months, years, etc.) (also include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?)
4. Bash shim to lump it all together and update?  Make sure don't re-download everything
- Need to deal with renames, etc
5. Easy way to get graphs on wiki (ugh commons)
- Use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Graph:Chart
6. Advertize?  WT:ADMIN, RFA, BN, INACTIVEADMIN
