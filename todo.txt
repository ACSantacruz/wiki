##### Possible additions

    * Or S-index for each individual action family? (d/b/p-index)
    * Leaves out import and rights only
        * Minor issue, likely, but could be interesting

##### XTool questions
- Date in range (defaults to 00:00 UTC start date, 23:59 UTC end date)
- How determine who was former sysop?  I think it's accurate but curious
- Any chance any users who were never sysops in there?
    - Just based off presence of log entries
- Revdel in delete?  Log revdel in delete?
- Specify range in api?
