### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?


#### S-index
##### Todo
1. More exotic export options
2. CHECK DATA
    1. Delete old files
3. S-index, s-index, S index, s index, or what?
    1.  Put in directories
4. Clean up code
5. Easy way to get graphs on wiki (ugh commons)
6. Advertize?  WT:ADMIN, RFA, BN, INACTIVEADMIN

##### Possible additions
1. Justify title and legend left?  Gets complicated...
2. S-index for just delete/protect/block totals?
    1. Or S-index for each individual action family? (d/b/p-index)
    2. Leaves out import and rights only
        1. Minor issue, likely, but could be interesting
3. Also include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?

##### XTool questions
- Date in range (defaults to 00:00 UTC start date, 23:59 UTC end date)
- How determine who was former sysop?  I think it's accurate but curious
- Revdel in delete?  Log revdel in delete?
- Specify range in api?
