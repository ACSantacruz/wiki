### Todo List

#### Wikispecies
1. Maybe figure out redirects?
2. Investigate linking and output (pdf?  wikitext?)
3. Cleanup, rerun, maybe publish?

#### S-index
- calch = bulk calc over period, goes through h_index files for each month, calls sysop
- sysop = actual calculations
1. (Re)Write
- Format changed between 18 feb 2010 and 21 feb 2010
- Start March 2010, or process separately
- sysop to take only user and total
- getdata to save and name
- table to take name and save
2. Map out pipline (what categories, what measures, etc.)
- finance isn't rolling, quarter is
- could set up rolling average, allow x number of months
- then make quarters quarters like finance
- make years years
- add academic calendar a la non rolling
- remove problematic users?
3. Figure out how I want to graph various data (quarters, months, years, etc.) (also include number of sysops, number of active sysops, etc.?)
4. Rewrite analysis based off downloadable data?
- No data from March 6 to May 9 in 2012
- Use data in timestamps from each month to confirm source
5. Bash shim to lump it all together and update?  Make sure don't re-download everything
- Need to deal with renames, etc
6. Easy way to get graphs on wiki (ugh commons)
7. Advertize?  WT:ADMIN, RFA, BN, INACTIVEADMIN
