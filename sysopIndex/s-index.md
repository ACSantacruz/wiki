{{Nutshell|}}

The number of enWiki sysops has been in a steady decline for years.  It is a recurring topic of conversation at [[WT:RFA]] and elsewhere, it has been extensively covered at the Signpost, and many  causes and solutions have been offered and discussed.  The ''s''-index is a metric for assessing the activity of the entire corps of sysops.  It is analogous to the [[h-index|''h''-index]] for academics.

== What is it? ==
The [[h-index|''h''-index]] "{{tq|attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications}}" of an academic, measuring the number of papers ''h'' with at least ''h'' citations.  An ''h''-index of five means the author has five papers that have been cited at least five times each, while an ''h''-index of 11 means the author has published 11 with at least 11 citations.  The intent of the ''h''-index is to measure both output and impact, not just quantity of either.  Note that moving from an ''h''-index of 11 to 12 requires publishing not just another paper, and not just having it cited 12 times, but also having 11 of your previous papers each citated at least once more.  A similar metric used in cycling is the [[Arthur Eddington#Eddington number for cycling|Eddington number]].

By analogy, this page displays the ''s''-index, or sysop index, which measures ''s'', the number of sysops who took at least ''s'' administrator actions in a given period.
